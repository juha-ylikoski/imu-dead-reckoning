# Pedestrian dead reckoning with IMU-sensors

Collection of inertial odometry methods and their evaluation. This repository is part of my [Bachelor's thesis](https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:tuni-202206165704).

Inertial odometry was estimated with two methods [ronin](https://github.com/Sachini/ronin) and [deep-speed-constrained-ins](https://github.com/AaltoVision/deep-speed-constrained-ins) both of which promised similar results with pedestrian imu dead reckoning.

## Dependencies
