# Pedestrian dead reckoning with IMU-sensors

Collection of inertial odometry methods and their evaluation. This repository is part of my Bachelor's thesis [LINK].

Inertial odometry was estimated with two methods [ronin](https://github.com/Sachini/ronin) and [deep-speed-constrained-ins](https://github.com/AaltoVision/deep-speed-constrained-ins) both of which promised similar results with pedestrian imu dead reckoning.

## Dependencies

See requirements.txt. Python version used == 3.9.0.
